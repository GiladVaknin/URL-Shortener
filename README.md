# ![Scale-Up Velocity](./readme-files/logo-main.png) Final 1 - URL shortner ðŸ“Ž

In this project I created my own [URL shortener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening)!

## Bonuses

- Add an button that click on it shows the last 5 URLS that shorted .
- Add an search line that find the url object that the client insert it's "shortURL : id" and shows him the statistics of it.
  -Add an function that shows the client the new shorted url after he enter the original one and creates an link that will open it in new tab.
